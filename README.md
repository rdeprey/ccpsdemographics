# ccpsdemographics

This single page website illustrates the changing student demographics for the public schools in Charles County, Maryland.

Tools that were used to help along the way:
- Bootstrap (mainly for CSS)
- jQuery (because it's awesome)
- d3.js (for the summary chart)
- jquery.tipsy.js (for the tooltip on the summary chart)
- Leaflet (for the map)

Improvements that can be made:
- Replace an old JavaScript utility that joins arrays by property/value (refuse to mention by name), maybe use Lo-Dash or Underscore.
- Make the d3.js chart interactive, perhaps buttons to filter on grade level.
- Improve the UI/UX (especially for mobile)
